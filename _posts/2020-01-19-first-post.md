Hi! This is my first post on this site. Someday this place will be filled with
technical commentaries and whatnot. Until then, let me tell you a little story.

# The Troubled Aardvark
by Tom Annau

Once upon a time, there was an aardvark whose only pleasure in life was driving
from his suburban bungalow to his job at a large brokerage house in his brand
new 4x4. He hated his manipulative boss, his conniving and unethical co-workers,
his greedy wife, and his snivelling, spoiled children. One day, the aardvark
reflected on the meaning of his life and his career and on the unchecked,
catastrophic decline of his nation, its pathetic excuse for leadership, and the
complete ineffectiveness of any personal effort he could make to change the
status quo. Overcome by a wave of utter depression and self-doubt, he decided to
take the only course of action that would bring him greater comfort and
happiness: he drove to the mall and bought imported consumer electronics goods.

Moral of the story: Invest in foreign consumer electronics manufacturers.
